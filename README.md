## 🎯 Key Insights
- Electronics leads the total potential revenue massively with aproximately $98 billion potential revenue.
  - Electronics is the most profitable focus area. Marketers and product teams should prioritize this category for campaigns and stock optimization.
- Electronics is not only the top revenue category but also attracts the most customer engagement of approximately 15.78 million reviews.
- Tech accessories drive consistent high volume engagement as the most reviewed product is in the Electronics Category.
- Accessories and small electronics dominate top-rated product lists, showing where customer satisfaction is highest.
- 751 products (over 50% of the data set) had discounts of 50% or more. This indicates aggressive discounting. Sellers should implement a balance so as to maintain product value perception.
 - Products with higher discounts (>50%) tend to have slightly lower average ratings (4.06) compared to products with <20% discount (4.17), suggesting a potential negative relationship between heavy discounting and perceived product quality.
- 328 products have lower than 1000 reviews. This indicates that many products have low visibility which in turn presents opportunities for marketing and review generation
